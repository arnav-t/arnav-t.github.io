      <description>Simulating soft-bodies using springs   Soft-bodies are fun to play around with. It is quite satisfying to throw around a soft-body in a simulation and watch the seemingly complicated behavior that unfolds.
However, the truth is, soft-bodies are far simpler to simulate than rigid bodies. Rigid bodies require more involved impulse calculations whereas a simple convex-rigid body simulation can just be approximated using point-to-point interactions. This can be simplified much further when the interactions are between a plane and a body, in fact, the body doesn&amp;rsquo;t even need to convex anymore.</description>
