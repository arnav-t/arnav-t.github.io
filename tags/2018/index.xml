      <description>Generating interesting patterns using pursuit curves  Let&amp;rsquo;s say we have a point A traveling on an arbitrary path and another point B pursuing point A such that its velocity is always directed towards point A. The path traced by point B is called a pursuit curve. The tangent of the pursuit curve will always pass through the pursuee&amp;rsquo;s position at that moment of time.
With this simple rule, nothing special happens if the pursuee is just traveling on a fixed path with a constant velocity.</description>

      <description>Using 3D configuration spaces for navigating 2D objects with A* pathfinding algorithm Pathfinding is a very interesting problem. There are already many popular algorithms for finding a path from point A to B such as Dijkstra&amp;rsquo;s algorithm and A* algorithm. However, they operate on the assumption that your path can *squeeze* through the smallest of gaps. Clearly, this would be a problem if you wanted to find a path for a finite object.</description>
