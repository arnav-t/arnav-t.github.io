      <description>Generating interesting patterns using pursuit curves  Let&amp;rsquo;s say we have a point A traveling on an arbitrary path and another point B pursuing point A such that its velocity is always directed towards point A. The path traced by point B is called a pursuit curve. The tangent of the pursuit curve will always pass through the pursuee&amp;rsquo;s position at that moment of time.
With this simple rule, nothing special happens if the pursuee is just traveling on a fixed path with a constant velocity.</description>
