      <description>Boids: simulating the flocking behavior of birds  Bird-oid objects or &amp;ldquo;boids&amp;rdquo; for short is a simple way to simulate the flocking behavior of birds using some simple rules. Boids exhibit emergent behavior (similar to pursuit curves) which means that the complexity of Boids arises from the interaction of many boids together adhering to a set of simple rules.
A typical simulation has three main rules:
 Separation: boids try to avoid colliding with each other.</description>

      <description>Generating interesting patterns using pursuit curves  Let&amp;rsquo;s say we have a point A traveling on an arbitrary path and another point B pursuing point A such that its velocity is always directed towards point A. The path traced by point B is called a pursuit curve. The tangent of the pursuit curve will always pass through the pursuee&amp;rsquo;s position at that moment of time.
With this simple rule, nothing special happens if the pursuee is just traveling on a fixed path with a constant velocity.</description>
