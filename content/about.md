Hello! I'm **Arnav Tiwari**, an undergraduate engineering student at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur. I'm an autodidactic software developer by trade. What kind? I'm figuring it out as I go!        
I love to build things and tinker with technology as much as the next hobbyist. Feel free to reach out to me at my email or any other social media, I love to collaborate!
